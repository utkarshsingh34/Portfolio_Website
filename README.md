🌿 Personal Website – A Digital Identity by [Your Name]
Welcome to my personal corner of the internet — a space designed not just to showcase what I’ve done, but to explore who I am becoming.

📌 What is this?
This is my digital identity, a custom-coded website that reflects my:

💼 Work – Projects, designs, ideas I’ve built and shaped

🎨 Personality – A bit of flair, creativity, and visual storytelling

🧠 Reflections – A space to write about my experiences, what they taught me, and the evolving perspectives they brought

Think of it as a blend of a portfolio, a blog, and a garden of thought — where content grows, changes, and blooms over time.

💡 Why I made this
I didn’t want a cookie-cutter portfolio.
I wanted something uniquely mine — something that not only shows what I do, but why I do it.

This site is my attempt to:

Build in public

Reflect intentionally

Design purposefully

Share honestly

🌱 A Garden of Reflection
“Your website should be a home, not a billboard.”

This space will continue to evolve — just like I do.
New pages, new insights, new ways of seeing the world — all will find their place here, growing over time.

Thanks for stopping by ✨
